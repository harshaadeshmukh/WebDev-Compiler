# WebDev-Compiler 🚀

**WebDev-Compiler** is a full-stack web-based coding environment that allows users to write, execute, and preview **JavaScript** code in real time. This project provides a seamless and interactive coding experience using a **React.js frontend with Redux for state management**, a **Node.js & Express.js backend**, and a **MongoDB Compass database**. The application is deployed on **Vercel**, ensuring high performance and accessibility.

## What I Have Built
I developed **WebDev-Compiler** as a complete **full-stack web application**, handling:

- **Frontend Development** using **React.js & TypeScript** for a responsive and dynamic UI.
- **State Management** using **Redux** to efficiently handle application state.
- **Backend Development** with **Node.js & Express.js** for secure and efficient JavaScript execution.
- **Database Management** using **MongoDB Compass**, allowing users to store code snippets and retrieve execution history.
- **REST API Development** to handle user requests and code execution.
- **API Testing** using **Insomnia** to ensure reliable and secure API endpoints.
- **Real-Time Code Execution**, where users can instantly see the results of their JavaScript code.
- **Deployment & Hosting** on **Vercel** to ensure a fast and scalable web application.

## Key Features
- 🖥️ **Live JavaScript Editor** – Write and edit JavaScript in an interactive, user-friendly interface.
- ⚡ **Real-Time Output Preview** – Instantly see the changes in the output as you type.
- 🔍 **Syntax Highlighting** – Enhanced readability and easier debugging with color-coded syntax.
- 🚀 **React & TypeScript Powered Frontend** – Ensures smooth performance and an optimized user experience.
- 🛠️ **Redux for State Management** – Efficiently handles application-wide state.
- 🛠️ **Node.js & Express.js Backend** – Handles JavaScript execution securely and efficiently.
- 📦 **MongoDB Compass Integration** – Allows users to save and manage code snippets.
- 🌐 **Fully Responsive Design** – Works across all devices, from desktops to mobile screens.
- 🔗 **API Testing with Insomnia** – Ensures robust and secure API interactions.
- 📤 **Vercel Deployment** – Ensures fast, scalable, and globally available hosting.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js, TypeScript, Redux
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB (via MongoDB Compass)
- **API Testing:** Insomnia


## Future Enhancements
- **User Authentication** – Allow users to log in and manage saved projects.
- **Multi-Language Support** – Extend execution capabilities to Python, Java, and more.
- **Real-Time Collaboration** – Enable multiple users to edit code together.

## Use Cases
- 💻 **Learning & Education** – A great tool for beginners to practice JavaScript.
- 🚀 **Rapid Prototyping** – Quickly test JavaScript ideas before full-scale implementation.
- 📝 **Technical Assessments** – An ideal environment for coding interviews and tests.
